This is a Pay Role Management webpage.Here, we are going to take the input bill amount and handle the error cases so that it throws an error if someone uses the negative value of bill amount or more than the given amount. Then we are going to apply our main logic to show the output of the minimum number of notes possible to return to the user as output(table). This webpage will actually count the minimum number of notes that the customer will get as a return in balance. Suppose the bill amount is 500 and you have a 2000 rupee so it calculates what no of minimum notes to be returned to the user.
